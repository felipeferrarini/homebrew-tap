  caveats <<~EOS
    PRPulse is not signed with an Apple Developer ID, so macOS blocks the first launch.
    Click OK on the warning, then go to System Settings > Privacy & Security and click
    "Open Anyway" next to PRPulse. Or, in the terminal:

      xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/PRPulse.app

    You only do this once: the automatic updates should not ask again.
